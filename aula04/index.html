    <h2>A empresa</h2>
      <p>
        A palavra empresa (do latim *imprehensa-, "empreendida", pelo italiano impresa, "empresa") significa "tarefa ou empreendimento de execução difícil e/ou laboriosa; realização; empreendimento; projecto."
      </p>
      <p>
      As pequenas empresas são guiadas pelas imagens de rentabilidade e valor estável a longo prazo, enquanto que as startups estão focadas nas receitas para seu financiamento e no potencial de crescimento. Isso significa que, para ser uma startup, são necessários alguns pré-requisitos não obrigatórios em empresas comuns.

      "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"
